# Cross-Border-Payments-Blockchain
Cross-border payments have grown in economic importance over the last few decades
as international mobility of goods, services, capital, and people has increased. Some
estimate that the value of cross-border payments will increase by $100 trillion over the
next ten years. This is why cross-border payments are such an intriguing and important
issue. Cross-border payments are more difficult than domestic payments. The
challenges are speed – slower transactions – cost – high remittance – access – difficult
to keep track – and low transparency. So, there is clearly a need to improve
cross-border payments and bring them up to speed with domestic payments. The
presence of corresponding banking networks is one of the key factors slowing down this
process. The introduction of blockchain to this system could help solve some of the
previously discussed issues by lowering costs, increasing transparency, and decreasing
time. In this project, we'll try to address cross-border payments by developing a Ethereum based
smart contract with various functionalities and adding a foreign exchange component
that will deal with the exchange rates between different countries.
