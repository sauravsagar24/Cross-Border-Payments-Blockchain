# Cross-Border-Payments-Blockchain
Cross-Border-Payments have grown in economic importance over the last few decades
as international mobility of goods, services, capital, and people has increased. Some
estimate that the value of cross-border payments will increase by $100 trillion over the
next ten years. This is why cross-border payments are such an intriguing and important
issue. Cross-border payments are more difficult than domestic payments. The
challenges are speed – slower transactions – cost – high remittance – access – difficult
to keep track – and low transparency. So, there is clearly a need to improve
cross-border payments and bring them up to speed with domestic payments. The
presence of corresponding banking networks is one of the key factors slowing down this
process. The introduction of blockchain to this system could help solve some of the
previously discussed issues by lowering costs, increasing transparency, and decreasing
time. 

The goal of blockchain in Cross-Border-Payments is to achieve data consistency among nodes in peer-to-peer
networks without the use of a third party or centralized mediation. In cross-border
payments, blockchain technology allows for secure transfers between an infinite number
of bank ledgers. This allows one to avoid banking intermediaries, who act as
go-betweens for money transfers from one bank to another. The transaction is secure,
faster, and less expensive, with end-to-end visibility from anywhere on the planet.
